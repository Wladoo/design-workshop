# How to design a Holochain Applicaion
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview 
Duration: 2

> This workshop is a work in progress. [Contributions](https://github.com/holochain-community-resources/design-workshop/issues) are greatly appreciated!

### Goal

**Have an idea for a holochain app?**

Follow along this codelab to get a **first draft of a design** for your hApp.

### What You’ll Learn 

You'll learn to:

- **Use common patterns** to build hApps
- **Architect DHTs** to match your functional requirements
- **Define membranes** around DHT shared spaces
- Design **complex information flows** across shared spaces
- Break down architectural components into **modular zomes**
- **Design entries and links** for every zome

### Requirements

It is highly recommended to do this workshop after:

* Having read/understood the holochain [Core Concepts](https://developer.holochain.org/docs/concepts/).
* Having built a simple Hello-World happ, either following the [tutorial](https://developer.holochain.org/docs/tutorials/coreconcepts/hello_holo/) or by having attended one of the hAppathons around the world. 

This way you will already know the basic primitives and building blocks available to us.
